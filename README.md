# 🎭 Narrata – A Text-Based Game Maker

### ⚠️ Still in initial development – Expect Bugs ⚠️
### Current Version: v0.1.0-pre-alpha

Alright, so Narrata is **not** just an RPG Maker. It’s a full-on **text-based game engine** that lets you build whatever thing you want. **Turn-based battles?** Yep. **Branching dialogue?** Easy. **Something completely different?** Yeah ok, I hope it works. No templates, no weird restrictions—just a bunch of tools for making the game **you** want.

## 💡 Why Narrata Though?
- **Fluxura-Powered Styling** – Colors, bold text, animations, make it look cool.
- **Make It Your Own** – Custom combat, enemies, UI, dialogue—yeah do what you want.
- **Actually Fun to Use** – No complicated setup, just Python.

## 🎮 What Can You Do With It?

✔ **Turn-Based Battles** – Build fights with enemies, attacks, and effects.
✔ **Choices That Matter** – Make branching stories that actually change things.
✔ **Text Effects** – Bold, colors, animations, make the terminal look cool.
✔ **Menus & UI** – Shops, settings, whatever you need.
✔ **Completely Customizable** – Just tools to build what **you** want.

## 📦 How to Install

Super easy:

```sh
pip install narrata
```

Narrata uses **Rich** for styling, **PyFiglet** for fancy text effects, and **Fluxura** for text customization, so those will get installed too.

(Yeah Rich does text customisation too but fluxura is our library so 😛)

## 🔥 Get Something Running in Seconds

Here’s a **tiny** game:

```python
# Yeah I'm still making the API lol
```

Run that, and boom—you’ve got something.
